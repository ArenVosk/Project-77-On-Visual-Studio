    To see your code in console screen you must write commands in JV[Javascript]. Here are the commands I wrote var first_name = "Aren ";
    var last_name = "Voskanyan";
    var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
    console.log("Hi I am Coding In Console Screen Where You Currently Are");
    console.log(full_name);
    
    var upercase_name = "AREN VOSKANYAN"
    var lowercase_name = upercase_name.toLowerCase();
    console.log(lowercase_name);
